# gdbpython

Author: *EwaÃ«l*

This script contains some useful functions when it comes to *Python* scripting in `gdb`. I was bored to copy them again and again when doing reversing challenges so I decided to create a little wrapper containing all of them.

This repo is public because I feel like there are not that many ressources about scripting in `gdb`. This was written for my personnal usage and environnement so do not expect it to work flowlessly if using it as such. Also note that this should **NEVER** be run as `root` as I create and delete a temporary file when getting the binary entry point.

Of course this will always be a work in progress as I will add features and fix the code directly and only on the `master` branch because I'm lazy. Thus again do not expect it to work at any time, I'm just sharing this because I'm pretty sure it could help someone one day.

## Usage

You can either copy the functions that interest you manually and import the `gdb` module to keep the verbose interface of `peda` during execution, or import this module directly:

```python
import gdbpython as g
```

You must also add this repository to your `PYTHONPATH` if you try to import the module:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gdb-python
```

The followings packages are required to enjoy every functions of the script:

```
readelf
gdb
```

I **HIGHLY** suggest to use it with [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda). Not only because it is an insanely powerful tool but also because I do not even know if this works in a *vanilla* `gdb`.

The followings *Python* 3 libraries are also required:

```
gdb
os
tempfile
random
string
```

Then you can use your script in `gdb` this way:

```
gdb -q -x script.py
```

## TODO

* *typing* (see [doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html))
* cleaner code + clearer doc
* better functions names
* temporary breakpoints
* context command to use it after exec

## Documentation (WIP)

---
```python
def exc(cmd, debug=False)
```
Execute given `cmd` and return output.

---
```python
def context()
```
Return colored `context`. Useful after execution because the output is not printed after commands. Should be called this way:
```python
print(context())
```

---
```python
def cont()
```
Continue execution and return output.


#### Breakpoints

---
```python
def bs(symbol)
```
Break on symbol `symbol`.
```python
bs('main')
bs('myfunction+305')
```

---
```python
def ba(addr)
```
Break at address `addr`.
```python
ba(0xdeadbeef)
```

---
```python
def f(filename)
```
Define `filename` as the debugged file.

---
```python
def getRandomString(size)
```
Return random string of `size` chars.

---
```python
def getEntry(filename, debug=False)
```
Return entry point of binary `filename`.

---
```python
def init(filename, entry=None)
```
Define the file `filename` as the currently debugged file and break at its entry point. If `entry` is provided the it breaks at `entry` address instead.

---
```python
def run(stdin=None, stdin_cmd=None, args=[])
```
Run with `stdin` **OR** `args`.

---
```python
def get(symbol)
```
Return given symbol.
